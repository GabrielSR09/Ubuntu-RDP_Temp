## üìñ About:
**Ubuntu RDP**: is an extraordinary repository that grants users a complimentary Ubuntu RDP server which is configured to have `xfce` desktop environment by default using a hosted virtual machine that is offered by GitHub to run workflows, which is also referred to as GitHub-hosted runner or runner operating system (OS).

### ü§î How to get an Ubuntu RDP server ?
To obtain an Ubuntu RDP server, you need to acquire knowledge about 'How to run `GitHub's workflows`?' If you are aware of that, then you must have used or heard about `inputs` (which are passed to the called workflow from the caller workflow). If you have heard of that, then it will be easy for you to get started because we are going to need some required information from you via `inputs`. You might be wondering, 'Why are `inputs` needed?' Well, we need them to configure the following things:

| Names OF Variables: | Description:                                                                                        | Default values: |
| :-----------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| `hostname`          | Stores your input to set host's name according to your provided information.                        | `ubuntu`        |
| `username`          | Takes input from you to create a new user as per your given instruction.                            | `user`          |
| `password`          | Asks you to enter a passcode which is used later to setup a new user.                               | `root`          |
| `Pin`               | A numeric pincode is stored to set a PIN which is used to connect with RDP server.                  | `123456`        |
| `CRP`               | Requires a command that you have to get it from [`here`](http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless). | -               |

**Once you have familiarized yourself with the information provided above, proceed with the following steps to acquire an Ubuntu RDP server:** <br>
**Step 1:** You have to clone or create a fork of [`this`](https://github.com/Diwash0007/Ubuntu-RDP) repository either to your GitHub's account or to your GitHub's organization account. <br>
**Step 2:** Now, go to your cloned or forked repository and, navigate to a section which is named as `Actions` to run [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow using your GitHub's account or your GitHub's organization account. <br>
**Step 3:** You will see a workflow which is named as `Ubuntu RDP` select that and, click `Run workflow` button to trigger [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow for performing further operations. <br>
**Step 4:** After that, you have to fill all required fields using `inputs` from my previous explanation then again click `Run workflow` button to finally start executing [`this`](.github/workflows/Ubuntu_RDP.yml) workflow. <br>
**Step 5:** Wait for your workflow to complete its running process and, if you got success you can see your RDP according to your provided name at [`http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless`](http://remotedesktop.google.com/headless) and, you can access it via `Pin` that you provided during provision of `inputs` process.
